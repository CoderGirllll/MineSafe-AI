Rockfall Prediction System for Indian Open Pit Mines
A comprehensive machine learning system for predicting rockfall hazards in Indian open pit mining operations.

🎯 Project Overview
This project implements a state-of-the-art machine learning system to predict rockfall risks in open pit mines across India. The system considers geological, environmental, and operational factors specific to Indian mining conditions including monsoon impacts, diverse geology, and varying mining practices.

🔧 Features
Multi-factor Risk Assessment: Considers 20+ geological, environmental, and operational parameters

Indian Mining Context: Specifically designed for Indian geological conditions and monsoon climate

Multiple ML Algorithms: Supports Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost

Real-time Predictions: Interactive prediction interface for immediate risk assessment

Comprehensive Reporting: Detailed risk reports with actionable recommendations

Dashboard Visualization: Interactive dashboards for risk monitoring
